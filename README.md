For useful graphical assets, we recommend you to install the React framework's Material-ui, which contain UI tools to help you ship new features faster :
  
  npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
  npm install @mui/icons-material
  
You'll find everything you need on the react official website https://reactjs.org/ and mui official website https://mui.com/ .
